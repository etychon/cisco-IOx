## Sample applications for Cisco IOx

Ready-to-use applications to run on Cisco IOx for various platforms. They are not all useful but at least they will get you started quickly.

* [iox-dumpenvvariables-aarch64.tar](iox-dumpenvvariables-aarch64.tar)

This IOx application is made for ARM-based IOx platforms such as IR1101 and IR3400. It will show and display all the environment variables configured inside the container. This will be visible in the application log file (accessible with Cisco IOx Local Manager or FD-based platforms such as GMM and FND).
